This project is part of a coding challenge. It analyzes survey data to understand Canadians' readiness to resume various activities post-pandemic across different age groups. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation using R. Key insights are presented through a heatmap of average readiness scores and a stacked bar chart of readiness levels for different behaviors and age groups. The project leverages RMarkdown for documentation and reporting.
